# ServiceLocator
Simple C# Service Locator built with .NET Standard 2.1. Future builds will use .NET 5.

# Thread Safety
Currently thread safety is not guaranteed but in most cases this should not matter as long as you don't try adding new services from multiple threads.
Thread safety will be adressed in a future release.
